###### Building a Voice-Activated Attendance System using Python
In this GitHub article, we will discuss how to create a Voice-Activated Attendance System using Python. This system uses face recognition technology to recognize individuals and record their attendance in a CSV file. Additionally, it utilizes the pyttsx3 library to provide voice feedback upon successful recognition.
##### Introduction
Attendance tracking is crucial in various organizations and educational institutions. Traditional methods of taking attendance can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To address these issues, we have created a Voice-Activated Attendance System that automates the attendance tracking process.

#### Pre-requisites
Before you proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. Python 3
2. OpenCV (cv2)
3. face_recognition
4. numpy
5. pyttsx3
You can install these dependencies using pip:

###### How It Works
This system captures video from the webcam and uses face recognition to detect and recognize faces. When a recognized face is detected, it speaks a welcome message using the pyttsx3 library and records the attendance in a CSV file.

##### Conclusion
By following this guide and using the provided code, you can create your own Voice-Activated Attendance System. This system can be further customized and integrated into various applications to simplify attendance tracking. Enjoy exploring and improving upon this project!
